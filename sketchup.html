    <p>Some creations I made with a 3D moddeling service called Sketchup during my Grade 9 Tech Class</p>
    <img src="dripshack.jpg" alt="a small shack with a car on the side">
    <p>A small shack that I made during my Grade 9 Tech Course, the shack itself was really easy to make, personally the car on the side is my favorite part.</p>
    <img src="bookshelf.jpg" alt="a bookshelf with some books and a Playstation 5 on the bottom">
    <p>a small bookshelf with a lot of books and this lucky person apparently has a PS5 as well, the bookshelf was really easy to make but personally I find it nice to look at.</p>
    <img src="painhouse.jpg" alt="A small house that was seriously difficult to make and took many attempts to make">
