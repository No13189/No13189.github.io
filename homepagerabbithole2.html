      <p>Well then you're gonna keep going? I'm genuinely not certain what to put here lol I'll probably make a bunch of wix websites that just have memes or something like the bobux generator in the homepage which if you haven't looked at yet, please do. I'm also gonna probably put some funny videos and stuff.</p><br>
      <p>Also how did you even find this website? like I haven't promoted it or anything so do you just know me or did you just randomly find this website? Maybe I'll make a google form to just ask you but other than that I'm really at a loss as to what I should say and or do...</p><br>
